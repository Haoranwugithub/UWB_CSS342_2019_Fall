# CSS 342 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics I

## Course Info
This course is designed as a fast-paced course along with CSS 343, in order to prepare students for more advanced level CSS courses. This course is integrating mathematical principles with detailed instruction in computer programming. We will Explore mathematical reasoning and discrete structures through object-oriented programming. Topics include algorithm analysis, basic abstract data types, and data structures.

## Prerequisites
a minimum grade of 2.8 in either CSS 133, CSS 143, CSE 143, or CSS 162; and minimum grade of 2.5 in either STMATH 125 or MATH 125.

## Course Objectives
The objectives of this course are for students to: 
- Understand how to analyze a problem and design a solution
- Have a basic understanding of the C++ language and the basics of object-oriented programming
- Know basic data structures, algorithms, and the tradeoffs among memory, running time, and implementation time associated with them. 

## Course Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the course, students shall be able to:
- Analyze problem and design solutions with basic data structures, algorithms
- Make trade of between solutions based on performance analysic in terms of time and space complexity
- Implement solutions proficiently in C++ with STL (Standard Template Library)
- Write well-structured and test-friendly codes
- Write solid testing with popular testing frameworks such as Googletest
- Debug programs with command line and IDE tools, and online community like https://stackoverflow.com/
- Work comfortably with source control and online repo such as Git and github.com
